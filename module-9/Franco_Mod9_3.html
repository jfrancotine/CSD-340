	<p class="intro">13 Then <span id = "Jesus">___________</span> came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be <span id = "baptized">____________</span> by him. 14 John would have prevented him, saying, "I need to be </p> 
	<p>baptized by you, and do you come to me?" 15 But Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness."</p>

	<p><span id = "beloved Son">____________</span>, with whom I am well pleased."</p>
